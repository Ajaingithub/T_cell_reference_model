# T_cell_reference_LGBM_model
This would help in predicting the cell types which has been trained on the data using different algorithm.
the LGMB is the fastest and most accurate with accuracy of 91.23 
With new data we can also make accuracy better than this and apply the model on the T cell dataset for both CD4 and CD8 that has been activated for 42 hrs.
